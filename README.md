# Specifying a Bayesian Model in PyMC
This repository contains a skeletal notebook used to demo how to construct a Marketing Mix Model (MMM) with PyMC. In particular, this notebook is used for reference in a series of articles on MMM - see here.

**Note** : the fictitous dataset used in this notebook was taken from Project Robyn ([ref](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/tree/main/R/data)) and is not representative of the marketing activity of any real company
