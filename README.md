# Specifying a Bayesian Model in PyMC
This repository contains a skeletal notebook used to demo how to construct a Marketing Mix Model (MMM) with PyMC. In particular, this notebook is used for reference in a series of articles on MMM - see, [Marketing Mix Modeling at Qonto Part V: Inputs for a Bayesian model](https://medium.com/qonto-way/marketing-measurement-series-marketing-mix-modeling-at-qonto-f214ba550968). Links to the other articles in the series can found within this article.

**Requirements**. You will need to install PyMC - see this [guide](https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/stable/installation.html).

**Note** : the fictitous dataset used in this notebook was taken from Project Robyn ([ref](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/tree/main/R/data)) and is not representative of the marketing activity of any real company
